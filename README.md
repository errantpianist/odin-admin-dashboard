# Odin Admin Dashboard

Honestly, quite a fun project making use of a lot of CSS grid. It was a challenge to get everything looking right for my screen size. Spending much of the time switching between windows or working split-screen made me want to get a second monitor.

Grateful to have the time at the moment to be working towards a goal every day.
